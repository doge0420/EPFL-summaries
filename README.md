# 📚 CS Docs Archive

This is a simple site I built to make it easier to browse all the CS lecture PDFs made by [Ali EL-AZDI](https://github.com/elazdi-al).

> ⚠️ I didn’t create the documents — all credit goes to [Ali EL-AZDI](https://github.com/elazdi-al). I just organized them here for easier access.
